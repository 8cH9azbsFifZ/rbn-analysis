The RBN uses the term "SNR" to denote its measure of the strength of a 
signal.

Normally, this term is intended to denote "signal to noise" ratio, although 
what is often meant by this is not the ratio of the signal to the noise, 
but rather the ratio (signal + noise) to noise. But in the case of the RBN, 
neither of these is related other than peripherally to the reported number.

The following information comes from VE3NEA, who is the author of the 
software used to report signals on the RBN.

The reported number is the ratio of two power levels, in dB. The numerator 
represents the total received power in a bandwidth of 50 Hz. In other 
words, it is the signal plus noise in a 50 Hz bandwidth. The denominator, 
however, is not a simple measurement: it is calculated in the following 
steps:

1. Determine the total received power in a bandwidth of (depending on the 
hardware), typically 200 kHz.

2. Divide this number by the bandwidth to determine a flux-per-Hz.

3. Normalise this value to a bandwidth of 500 Hz.

The result of step 3 is used as the denominator in the calculation of the 
number that is reported.

It is worth noting, then, that (1) the notional bandwidths for the numerator 
and the denominator are different; and (2) the denominator includes all the 
signals that are present in a wide bandwidth. During a busy contest 
weekend, these will likely vastly overwhelm the actual background noise -- 
and, in particular, will be a far cry from a measurement of the noise in a 
50 Hz bandwidth which would accord with the conventional notion of 
reporting the ration of signal to noise or (signal + noise) to noise.

VE3NEA states that the RBN does not report simply the total received flux 
in a standard bandwidth because SDR software has no capability to determine 
the actual signal strength at the input terminals.

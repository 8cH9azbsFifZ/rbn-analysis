This directory contains various files and scripts associated with analysing 
historical data from the Reverse Beacon Network ("RBN").

compare-sigs:
  Compare the signals between two stations over a given time period, on a 
  particular band and to a particular continent. Provides an estimate 
  of the difference between the means of the underlying signal 
  distributions, the 95% confidence limits of that estimate, and
  the probability that one signal really is stronger than the other. 

convert-rbn:
  Convert RBN data from the as-is format in the RBN zip files to the 
  single-file CSV format used by these scripts.
  
download-rbn:
  Download daily historical files from the RBN as-is, putting the data into 
  files with friendly names.

get-rbn:
  Bring local database (rbndata.csv)  up to date.
